		<h2>project overview</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of this project is to provide a public, interactive art installation that will allow people to confront the otherwise inaccessible elements of space travel that are already inherently tied to our lives. We rely on the services of these orbital launch rockets, whether it be for 5G internet or a fancy self-driving car, but rarely (if ever) have the opportunity to get up close and personal with the very vehicles that make such services available. This is a problem as Michigan very well could become center stage for the launching of these vehicles.

			I want this site to provoke discourse about humanity&apos;s relationship with space as it evolves from exploratory to commercial, and underscore the value of “ordinary” people&apos;s voices in monumental decisions, such as becoming the next a “hub” for space cargo runs. It is not my intention to sway people one way or the other &ndash; but rather for them to advocate for their own agency in this new territory so the decision is not solely that of millionaires and lobbyist organizations. Regardless if people leave my installation “pro” or “anti” spaceport, I want people in the Lower Peninsula an active stance in something that can and will affect their immediate future, as their northern neighbors already doing right now.

			Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. You know what? It is beets. I&apos;ve crashed into a beet truck. What do they got in there? King Kong? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Just my luck, no ice.

			You really think you can fly that thing? You&apos;re a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
